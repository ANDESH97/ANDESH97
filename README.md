- 👨🏻‍🔬  I like experimenting with latest tech. I am fascinated by Augmented Reality and the possibilities it can bring to our world. I'm also inclined on experimenting Computer Vision with AI which pushed me to build my own [Self-Driving RC Car](https://github.com/ANDESH97/Self_Driving_RC_Car)

- 🌱  I’m currently trying my hands on MERN Stack development.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on technology built for social good.
